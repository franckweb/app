# Icons

Directus heavily uses the Material Design icon set. Due to the fact that we want to support the usage of every icon available in a re-usable way, we decided to use the icon font.

Icons can be used at anytime by including an `i` tag with the `material-icons` class. The text content of this element is the name of the icon as listed on [https://material.io/tools/icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/).

## Example

```html
<i class="material-icons">backup</i>
<i class="material-icons">pan_tool</i>
<i class="material-icons">show_chart</i>
```
